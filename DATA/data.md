A Data Appendix file as a PDF, which will include text that you type, as 
well as tables, figures, and other descriptive statistics.
This file should be organized in sections, with a section for each dataset
analyzed. Each section should begin with a statement of what the unit
of observation is--that is, it should explain what kind of object each row
of the data file represents.
After that, you should include a subsection for each variable in the
analyzed dataset.
